<p>Creating a GitHub Page is super simple and easy. There's two different ways of creating <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Making a repository that matches your GitHub user name will create a main page. From then on you'll edit like you do with any other web page. Note: You can setup a GitHub page for any git repositories. How about we get started!</p>

<br>

<h3>Creating a Main GitHub Page</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new repo.</li>
	<li>Make a repository that matches your GitHub username <b>"gitusername.github.io"</b> then click <b>"Create repository"</b>.</li>
	<li>After your repository is created click on the, <b>"Repository Settings"</b> and then, <b>"Automatic Page Generator"</b>.</li>
	<li>Edit this generated page, as this will show as your homepage. You can also add a Google Analytics ID, but click <b>"Continue To Layouts"</b>.</li>
	<li>Select the theme that fits your mood and click <b>"Publish"</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, you finished the beginning! She'll be hosted under your username <code>http://___.github.io/</code></p>

<br>

<h3>Make a GitHub Page for your Current Repository</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Select your repo that you want a page for.</li>
	<li>Upload your HTML and CSS files.</li>
	<li>Click the drop down menu, <b>"Branch: master"</b> and type <b>"gh-pages"</b> to create.</li>
</ol>

<p>The site should be hosted under your GitHub username <code>http://___.github.io/repo</code> on a slow day give it 10 minutes for propagation. If you get stuck, or run into id10t errors, please read the <a href="https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles">GitHub Documentation</a>. Good Luck and Happy Coding!</p>
